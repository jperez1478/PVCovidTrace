## Current Problem 
As school reopen, it is impossible to ignore the effects COVID-19 has had on the learning environment as well as the concerns associated with COVID-19 and the lack of efficient contact tracing on campus.
In addition, almost all cases are reported on social media platforms, causing paranoia and many questions amongst students who live on campus. 

# Solution 
Our mobile application will have hotspots where ppl can check-in and have better accuracy to who was last there and who they were in contact with. 
In the map, it will also show the cases and date they have been reported. 
This will assist in knowing where to avoid while quantities happen. 
With this mobile application, college campuses can help better inform students and faculty which areas have had more cases.
